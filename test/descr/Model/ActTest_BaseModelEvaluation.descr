  Data Model expression evaluation

[1:OVERVIEW]

  Checks that Integer Variable Node is removed correctly. This means that all
  involved evaluation Tree Functions established in dependent Nodes have to be
  disconnected.

[2:OVERVIEW]

  Test on Dependency Analyzer tool: simple loop should be detected.

[3:OVERVIEW]

  Test on Dependency Analyzer tool: no loops should be detected.

[4:OVERVIEW]

  Test on Dependency Analyzer tool: simple loop should be detected.

[5:OVERVIEW]

  Test on Dependency Analyzer tool: no loops should be detected.
  
[6:OVERVIEW]

  Test on Dependency Analyzer tool: no loops should be detected.

[7:OVERVIEW]

  Test on Dependency Analyzer tool: infinite loop should be detected.

[7:DETAILS]

  The following case is checked:
  <pre>
    +==========+============+
    | Variable | Expression |
    +==========+============+
    | rX       | 1.0        |
    +----------+------------+
    | rY       | iX         |
    +----------+------------+
    | iX       | rX*rY      |
    +==========+============+
  </pre>
  Therefore, rY depends on iX, while iX depends on rY.

[8:OVERVIEW]

  Test function for renaming functionality for Variable Nodes.

[9:OVERVIEW]

  Test function for renaming functionality for Variable Nodes.

[10:OVERVIEW]

  Test function for renaming functionality for Variable Nodes. This one will
  test some special characters in Variable names, e.g. "_".

[11:OVERVIEW]

  Test function for adding new variable.
