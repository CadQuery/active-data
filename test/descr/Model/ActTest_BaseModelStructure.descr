  Data Model structure

[1:OVERVIEW]

  Checks whether FindNode method works properly.

[2:OVERVIEW]

  Checks whether DeleteNode method works properly on a root Node of
  the test Data Model.

[2:DETAILS]

  The expected result is to have a completely clean project hierarchy.

[3:OVERVIEW]

  Checks whether DeleteNode method works properly on an intermediate
  Node in the test hierarchy.

[4:OVERVIEW]

  Checks whether DeleteNode method works properly on an intermediate
  Node in the test hierarchy. In addition to the previous test, this one
  attempts to delete a Node having some referrers in the project tree.

[4:DETAILS]
  <pre>
     A --+
         |
         +--> D --> C
         |
     B --+
  </pre>
  In this scheme A and B refer to D, while D refers to C. Then Node D is
  removed. As a result, the Nodes A, B and C should still be there as they are
  not children of D. However, the Nodes A and B should loose their references
  to D. Moreover, Node C should loose its back-reference to D.

[5:OVERVIEW]

  Checks whether DeleteNode method works properly on an another intermediate
  Node in the test hierarchy. This time the Node being removed is a leaf in the
  tree, so project modification is minimal.

[6:OVERVIEW]

  Checks that back-references are established correctly for an intermediate Node
  in project hierarchy.
