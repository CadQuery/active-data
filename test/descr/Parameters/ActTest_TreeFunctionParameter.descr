  Tree Function Parameter

[1:OVERVIEW]

  Performs test on accessing Function Driver GUID and other related
  TDF Attributes which are forming the core of the OCCT TFunction mechanism.

[2:OVERVIEW]

  Performs test on "soft" disconnecting of Tree Function from CAF document. This operation
  presumes that all underlying CAF Attributes will be cleaned up, so that Parameter
  becomes void. However, the corresponding Tree Function is not completely erased from
  global map of functions.

[3:OVERVIEW]

  Performs test on full disconnecting of Tree Function from CAF document. This operation
  presumes that all underlying CAF Attributes will be cleaned up along with all
  references to the root TDF Label of Tree Function.
